â€™fil de fer' wireframe 3d model

this project is about representing a landscape as a 3D object in which all surfaces are outlined in lines.

## how to draw

mlx is a bit hard to comprehend, but only the math aside is another story. let me introduce you to concepts and vocabulary I came across during the realization of this project in order to succeed in it (or at least ty it)

- rasterisation: taking an image described in vectors and convert it into a series of pixels which, when displayed together look, create the image which was represented via shapes

- aliasing (staircasing) effect: distortion that happens when a signal is reconstructed in a smaller resolution than the original sample

- Bresenham's line algorithm: simple and rapid method that determines the points with a close approximation of a straight line between two points

## minilibx

oh god. here we go.

to compile properly make sure to add `-lmlx -framework OpenGL -framework AppKit` flags!!!

- `mlx_init()` initializes the graphic system to your computer. returns a pointer identifying your mlx unning instance

- `mlx_loop()` mantains the window open until a SIGINT is sent. its always waiting for an event
