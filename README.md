# fdf
â€™fil de fer' wireframe 3d model

this project is about representing a landscape as a 3D object in which all surfaces are outlined in lines.

## how to draw

mlx is a bit hard to comprehend, but only the math aside is another story. let me introduce you to concepts and vocabulary I came across during the realization of this project in order to succeed in it (or at least ty it)

- rasterisation: taking an image described in vectors and convert it into a series of pixels which, when displayed together look, create the image which was represented via shapes

- aliasing (staircasing) effect: distortion that happens when a signal is reconstructed in a smaller resolution than the original sample

- bits per pixel (bpp): the amount of color information contained in each pixel in an image

- size line: number of bytes used to store one line of the image in memory

### bresenham

Bresenham's line algorithm: simple and rapid method that determines the points with a close approximation of a straight line between two points

!!!!!add image coordinates

## minilibx

oh god. here we go.

to compile properly make sure to add `-lmlx -framework OpenGL -framework AppKit` flags!!!

- `mlx_init()` initializes the graphic system to your computer. returns a pointer identifying your mlx unning instance

- `mlx_loop()` mantains the window open until a SIGINT is sent. its always waiting for an event

### why use mlx images instead of pixel\_put?

using pixel put is way longer than managing a image in memory. to display just one pixel it has to access the program, draw the pixel on the desired coordinate, and return an integer. 

we rather buffer everything onto an image where we input all the information we want, and then draw everything at once.
